            <p>Woody is a speaker made of Indian rosewood, the material is also upcycled from a table.
               This was a project I had when I attended SKAP creative folk high school, and it was my first speaker project.
               The speaker is fully functional with buttons produced in the same material as the speaker. The shape of the speaker
               tapers backward, creating a seamless transition to the bass reflex tube at the back.

                    <h3>The Material</h3>
                    <p>The speaker is cut out of three different blocks made from planks from a table.
                        This gives the speaker its unique surface, where you can see the transition between the planks.

                    <h3>CNC</h3>
                    <p>Once again, CNC is the thing for making precision parts that need to fit together. Here you see the middle
                        block section being cut out. The inside is machined out and then turned to cut out the outside of the part.

                    <p>After all the parts are cut out, they are glued together and later sanded to achieve seamless transitions
                        between the three machined components.

                    <p>The buttons for the speaker are also made of wood. Here, CNC is also used to create the icons in the buttons.
