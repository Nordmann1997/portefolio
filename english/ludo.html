                <p>Ludo is a board game created under the design office at OsloMet Product Design. In short, it is a group of
                    students from all grades who solve a problem for an external client. This Ludo game is designed to be
                    aesthetically pleasing when the game is stored and works just as well as a decorative object as it does as a game.
                    The idea behind the game was to create a game that could be part of the interior of a home, without having to be hidden in a drawer or cupboard.

                            It is constructed in solid oak and is later painted with decoration.

                        <p>The game illustration is engraved with a laser cutter to create a lasting finish in the oak board.
                            The board is then covered with tape before another round of laser engraving, so that the game can be precisely colored in
                            the right areas.

                        <p>Here you can see the board after it has been laser cut with tape on. After this, the different fields are colored with
                            a brush and paint. When the tape is then removed, the paint remains with a perfect finish.
