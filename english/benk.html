                <p>This is an upcycling project where I have built a bench from materials saved from the landfill.
                   All the wood is Indian rosewood and is taken from an old table that was about to be thrown away.
                   The top glass plate is an old shelf that was also going to be thrown away but was saved at the last minute.
                   The side glass walls are taken from old mirrors where the mirror film has been removed and the glass has been cut to the correct dimensions.<br>
                   A closed terrarium is a self-sufficient ecosystem that recycles water and nutrients, creating a humid, stable environment
                   that requires no maintenance.
                   The moss inside, taken from the school's roof, would otherwise have been thrown away during spring cleaning.

                        <p>This is the table from which the materials were taken. Many give these away on Finn
                            because for them it has become an old and worn piece of furniture, but underneath hides a beautiful
                            material.

                        <h3>Turning the Legs</h3>
                        <p>The legs of the bench are the old table legs, solid wood in Indian rosewood. The legs were a bit too thick and had
                            some damage, so they were turned down to the right size and shape. This also brought out the beautiful color of the wood
                            that was hidden under old varnish.

                        <h3>Ensuring a Transition</h3>
                        <p>The attachment to the glass terrarium is made by creating a groove in each leg that the terrarium can rest in. This also provides
                            a nice transition from wood to glass and hides the corners of the terrarium.
