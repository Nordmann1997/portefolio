                    Oval is a speaker designed with a focus on interior design. The shape is soft with natural material choices that make it easy to integrate into the home.
                    The speaker is operated with a simple button, made of steel and pine for a soft tactile feel, but high strength for long-term use.
                    The speaker is machined out of pine, with a steel ring around it that provides a natural finish and start to the natural grain.

                        <p>The speaker's shape consists of two main parts, a top lid and a bottom. To make these in 
                            a precise form, I chose to use CNC. To achieve this, I made two blocks
                            made of cut 2x4 planks.

                        <p>To get precise measurements and the oval shape of the parts, I chose to use CNC.
                            This is a very precise way to shape wood and is programmed to follow a 
                            3D model of the speaker in Fusion 360.

                        <p>Here you can see how the parts look halfway through the process before being turned and when the machine is
                            finished with rough machining. After this, the machine is run again to give an almost
                            perfect finish.

                        <h3>From Mockup to Prototype</h3>
                        <p>Before I started machining, I made a mockup model in foam to visualize the size
                            and shape. Here you can see that the finished prototype is a bit larger with a slightly different shape.

                        <p>The speaker is a working prototype and I therefore needed a functional button. This is machined
                            out of steel with a button in the middle made of pine. Around the button is an acrylic ring that shows if 
                            the speaker is on and if it is in Bluetooth mode.
