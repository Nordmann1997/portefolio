                    This project was created in connection with a subject called material specialization. The chair is designed and built
                    in a way that only metal allows. The plates are only 2.5mm thick, but this chair can easily hold a person over 
                    100kg. The prototype is made of steel and with a foot taken from an old Bang & Olufsen TV, which also gives the chair an 
                    electric rotating function.

                        <h3>Cardboard Seat</h3>
                        <p>Before cutting out the seats in metal, I cut out the seats in cardboard to confirm that
                            the sizes are correct and that the length of the tube (the spine) is correct to get the right spacing between the seat plates.</p>

                        <h3>Plasma Cutter</h3>
                        <p>When the size of the seats was confirmed correct, the next step was to cut them out in metal.
                           I chose 2.5mm thick steel to provide good strength, but also to avoid it becoming too heavy.</p>

                        <h3>Reinforce the Structure</h3>
                        <p>2.5mm thick steel becomes a bit too weak on the longest seat plates. To maintain the minimalist and "light"
                            design, I welded a rod underneath that is otherwise invisible from most angles.</p>

                        <h3>The Spine</h3>
                        <p>The spine consists of 32 plasma-cut metal parts. These are welded together into a metal plate and then pressed 
                            into shape to give equal length and angle on both sides. These are then bolted to the seat plates and welded to
                            the tube.</p>

                        <h3>Test Fit</h3>
                        <p>A final test assembly remains before welding to check if adjustments are needed â€“ which they always are.
                            The vertebrae were later redesigned for better strength and adjusted to avoid sharp edges,
                            an important consideration if children are running around.</p>

                        <h3>Welding</h3>
                        <p>When all parts fit, welding remains. All vertebrae are mounted on the seat plates and then threaded onto the steel tube to
                            be welded in place. Here, the spacing between the seat plates was especially important to get right.</p>
